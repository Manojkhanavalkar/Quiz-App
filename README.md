# Quiz App

A simple and interactive **Quiz Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was created for practice to strengthen my front-end skills and learn JavaScript array methods like `reduce`, `map`, and event-driven programming.

## 🚀 Features

- Start quiz with a **Start** button  
- Multiple-choice questions displayed one at a time  
- **Next** button to move to the next question  
- **Restart** button to retake the quiz  
- Dynamic question rendering using JavaScript  
- Score calculation using array methods like `reduce`  
- Simple and responsive UI built with CSS

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — structure and layout  
- **CSS3** — styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — logic, DOM manipulation, quiz state management

## 📂 Project Structure

Quiz-App/
├── index.html # Main HTML page
├── styles.css # Styling for quiz UI
└── script.js # Core JavaScript logic

yaml
Copy code

- **index.html** → contains quiz container, buttons, and UI elements  
- **styles.css** → provides styling for quiz layout and buttons  
- **script.js** → handles quiz logic, events, scoring, and rendering

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User clicks **Start Quiz** → first question loads.  
2. User selects an answer → app checks correctness.  
3. Click **Next** → next question appears until quiz ends.  
4. Final **Score** is displayed at the end.  
5. **Restart** button resets quiz to play again.
